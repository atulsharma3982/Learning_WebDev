## 📝 About

"Learning Web Dev" is a hands‑on, project‑based web development course inspired by the "Sigma Web Dev" YouTube playlist. Each chapter in this repo corresponds to a specific video lesson, modeled after the approach of Harry Bhai's popular tutorials.

The goal is to build up your skills step‑by‑step, from basic HTML/CSS to JavaScript, frameworks, and modern tooling.
